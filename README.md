# Running Instructions

To run locally, you are going to need a webserver with php capabilities and python installed. The only dependency on here is PyDrive!
We ran the website locally by using the php cli, in order to do the same thing you are going to have to run the following commands:

1. If you have yet to clone the repo, `git clone git@github.com:hpache/SignLanguageWebsite.git` Make sure you are cloning to an easily accesible area! (i.e. desktop)
2. `cd SignLanguageWebsite`
3. `php -S localhost:8080` Can also do `php -S localhost:8000`
4. Go to your favorite browser and go to http://localhost:8080 or http://localhost:8000
5. Use the website to your heart's content :smile:
